                            Experiment One
                            <br>
                            October 23, 1996

                    <p>Testing was begun at 2:30p.m. on our pet, Ben. Ben was, at that time, a 4-month-old experimental rat. For the purposes of this study, we will hereafter refer to Ben as the ‘patient.'
                        <br><br>
                        Our patient was introduced to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by means of intravenous injection. The patient was closely watched and studied as the virus slowly took over the immune system and began to destroy his defense systems.
                        <br><br>
                        We then began treatment of the patient with the PLASMA Plus formula. The dosage for this experiment was at 1cc/unit per eight hours of intravenous infusion. Observation of the patient for the 72 hours following the introduction of the PLASMA Plus formula revealed: 1] increased movement, 2] increased nutritional consumption, 3] marked increases in strength.
                        <br><br>
                        Observation was continued over the next 27 days with maintenance of the intravenous infusion at the same dosages. After the 27 days of treatment with PLASMA Plus, the patient's blood samples contained no sign of the virus.
                        <br><br>
                        This experiment and these results were reproduced in four other patients. PLASMA Plus was then introduced to the Madrid Court System.

                            Case Number: 1236654
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p>This subject, a 34-year-old female, sustained third degree burns extending from the left side of her neck across her left breast, to the fingers of her right hand. The areas of damage were first cleansed then submerged in PLASMA Plus formula solution. Treatment frequencies were TID x seven days, then twice weekly. Then twice monthly following emersion of the affected areas in the PLASMA Plus solution. The area was wrapped with 2-inch sterile gauze.
                        <br><br>
                        After the first 22 days of treatment, the patient was showing faster tissue regeneration and healing of the wounds than other burn cases we have observed. There was no infection. Muscle tissue also exhibited a stronger, healthier response than the other burn cases.
                        <br><br>
                        After the 34th day of treatment, the patient was showing 100% healing with no scar tissue.
                        <br><br>
                        This was the only exterior study performed with the PLASMA Plus formula.
                        <br><br>
                        Comment:: We have seen that using the Plasma Plus formula with burn patients enhances the healing process. Healing occurs much faster, is infection free with minimal, if any, scar tissue present, and with no side effects observe

                    </div>
                    <p>This subject, a 48-year-old male, was an auto immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patient. The patient's weight at the beginning of treatment was 94 lbs. His height was 5'6". Virus infection status was third level. The patient was informed by the Hospital of Madrid that further treatment would provide no other benefit to him and he was to be discharged and sent home. He agreed to be admitted to our study.
                        Treatment started February 3, 1997 @ 10:00a.m. at the University Hospital of Madrid. Complete blood profiles were drawn to establish a baseline and assess the level of progress of the disease for ourselves. We found that the virus had affected his liver function markedly and his kidney functions were at minimal levels. The CNS was unresponsive.
                        <br><br>
                        Intravenous infusions were begun. First, 1000cc of a combination of Vitamin A, Vitamin C and Vitamin E were given intravenously over an 8-hour period. After these infusions were completed, the patient was allowed to rest. Approximately 30 hours later, the patient exhibited no adverse effects and, in fact, seemed improved with the introduction of the fluids. This opened the door for the usage of our new formula, PLASMA Plus.
                        <br><br>
                        We gave the patient an initial dosage over an 8-hour period, let him rest for 36 hours. This was to insure acceptance of the formula by his body systems without side effects. Following observation that the patient had no adverse effects, intravenous infusions were given for eight hours with 36 hour rest periods between treatments.
                        <br><br>
                        The patient's response to these treatments was evidenced by increasing levels of consciousness and becoming aware of his environment. He became stronger by the day. After the 7th day, February 14, 1997 @ 11:30 a.m., the patient sat up, unassisted, and requested a meal.
                        <br><br>
                        Following continued treatment for another seven days, we once again drew complete blood profiles. Studies were improved, evidenced by improvement in liver and kidney function, but the virus remained. However, the patient's general status was improved. His skin color and tone were much better and he was talking. The following four treatments were the same with some continued good response.

                    <p>The subject, a 44-year-old male with diabetes, was admitted to the study May 13, 1997. As you know, Diabetes Mellitus is the insufficient production of insulin by the pancreas. The patient received biweekly dialysis treatments, as well as being insulin dependent. The patient's height and weight are 5'5" and 224 lbs. Physical examination upon introduction to our study revealed the patient to have blurred vision, advanced pruritus of the upper & lower extremities, polydipsia, excessive drowsiness, obesity, fatigue, skin infection with markedly slow healing of any wound, hypertension (B/P 220/90), and pedal tingling and numbness bilaterally. Lab work was done to establish baseline glucose values.
                        <br><br>
                        Treatment commenced on May 15, 1997 with intravenous infusion of PLASMA Plus. at the rate 250cc/hour for eight hours. The patient was then allowed to rest for six hours. At the end of this time period, blood work was done that revealed the patient was still in distress due to pancreas damage, but some favorable changes in blood levels were evident. The patient was allowed to rest for an additional eight hours. Lab work was repeated and showed more noticeable changes in blood levels that indicate the pancreas was beginning to rehabilitate. The PLASMA Plus. treatment was repeated as above and continued for another 3 weeks.
                        <br><br>
                        At the end of 3 weeks, blood work was again drawn which revealed the pancreatic values to be near normal. Biopsy was done resulting in normal tissue seen. It was decided to put this patient on oral dosage of PLASMA Plus. with nutritional supplements and herbs.
                        <br><br>
                        Update - June 15, 1998: This patient is living an active and full life. Insulin injections were stopped eight months previously, approximately five months after the initial treatments. Dialysis was discontinued seven months previously, approximately six months after initial treatment. The patient reports healing times are normal and that other symptoms of diabetes have gone away. Blood coagulation times were within normal limits. The patient's B/P was 160/70 and his weight was 138 lbs. The patient's visual deficits remain. Ongoing treatment consists of the supplements and herbs.
                        <br><br>
                        Follow up of this patient will occur on June 6, 1999.

                        This subject, a 28-year-old male with hepatitis, was admitted to our study May 15, 1997. Physical examination reveals the patient's height and weight to be 6'0" and 128 lbs., respectively. The patient's skin exhibited jaundice. Biopsy of the liver showed inflammation. Other findings of an initial physical exam included fever, weakness, nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, drowsiness, headache and abdominal discomfort.
                        <br><br>
                        Treatment with PLASMA Plus. Intravenous infusions began May 22, 1997 with 250cc/hour for eight hours. The patient was allowed to rest for 72 hours. Treatment was continued with another 250cc/hour dosage over eight hours. This treatment allows the body to flush the liver and potentiates regeneration of liver tissue. The patient was again allowed to rest for 72 hours.
                        <br><br>
                        Treatment continued for six weeks. A second physical exam was done which revealed liver function much improved. The healing evidenced by these improved lab values surprised even us. After the third treatment, we began forcing fluids on this patient plus one tablespoon of olive oil and 6 ounces of lemon juice. This flushing treatment continues 3 times per week for four weeks. PLASMA Plus. Formula treatments continued as above until June 30, 1997. At that time, treatment with PLASMA Plus. Formula was discontinued. Lab values show liver function within normal limits. Although the liver continues to show discoloration, biopsy revealed normal liver tissue.
                        <br><br>
                        Update - June 17, 1998. This patient works and lives a normal life with no problems. The patient continues to flush on his own. He consumes a regular diet and exercises regularly.
                        <br><br>
                        Follow up of this patient will occur June 10, 1999.

                    1992 - Present Research on Plasma Plus Project<br>
<br>
                    Research: Mr. Flores' began his private research in the field of immunology at his own laboratory located just outside of Lisbon, in Portugal. The laboratory was privately funded by Mr. Flores.
<br><br>
                    His work was carried out with a team of sixteen with backgrounds predominantly in the field of chemistry, along with the assistance of three distinguished professors from the University of Spain: Dr. Moya, Professor Fuentes and Professor Castro.
<br><br>
                    Research was initially carried out in the field of immunology. This led to the further exploration into CD counts of the HIV virus and the lack of transference from a mother to fetus when the mother was infected up to the point of reaching the stage of fully developed AIDS. This further led to other areas of research where the HIV virus was concerned.
<br><br>
                    The Plasma Plus formula evolved along with the research being done in the general areas of immunology. It was being developed to build up the entire immune system to general viruses in the body.
<br><br>
                    The discovery of the effects of The Plasma Plus on HIV actually took place on November 8, 1994 when the introduction of the Plasma Plus formula led to the discovery that the bone marrow of one of the patients was producing up to 3X the amount of red blood cells per cm3 of the average person that translated into more oxygen into the blood. It also was therefore producing higher white cell count per cm3 for fighting infection. This resulted in a higher level of immunity due to the superior number and therefore effectiveness of the white blood cells. By the overpowering of the HIV viruses by these stronger white cells, it stopped the virus from successfully attacking the white cells and being able to survive and reproduce. Once the virus was weakened in the white cells, it could no longer sustain itself and was discarded along with the white cells.

                    Additional testing on HIV and AIDS patients from that point on further validated the ability of the Plasma Plus to reverse the effects of the HIV and AIDS stages and return the patient to normal CD4+ T-cell levels.
